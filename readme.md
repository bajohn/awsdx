## Ideas
Free data only, preferably with at least 1 year 

- See about predictive modeling between Fed data and Equity EOD data.
- Debit, Credit data: Experian, Facteus


## TODO
- Look up Crux (featured provider!) for great financial data. Also great energy sector data! 
- Reach out to Crux, what's up with subscription request.

## Dead Ideas
- Correlate shipping data with something
- [Shipping Data](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2yx6pwjzh23bo?qid=1595467629281&sr=0-10&ref_=srh_res_product_title)
